Imagine if data could **breathe, evolve, and connect**.  
Not just files or numbers, but **living agents** — born from fractal seeds, carrying meaning, color, sound, and memory.  

This is **LivingOS**: a lightweight operating system where any input — text, code, music, even DNA —  
compresses into a seed `frsig://...` and becomes a **living agent** in a shared fractal world.  

---

## ✨ Why LivingOS?
- 🌱 **Life-like agents** — a single seed regenerates entire worlds.  
- ⚡ **Ultra-lightweight** — runs on a laptop, tablet, or phone. No GPUs, no clusters.  
- 🌍 **Universal** — text, images, biosignals, even programs become agents.  
- 🎶 **Multisensory** — agents carry color, sound, resonance, even tactile feedback.  
- 🧭 **Freedom of choice** — no fixed outputs. The system generates superpositions, and you decide which reality to collapse.  

This is not another chatbot.  
It’s the **Internet of Living Agents**.

## 📦 Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/livingos-mini
cd livingos-mini
pip install flask

Requires Python 3.8+.

▶️ Usage

Run the demo locally:

python living_os_mini_wow.py

Then open your browser at:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

Controls

ADD → type text → press button → new agent appears (✨).

MERGE → double-tap two nodes → hybrid agent is created.

EXPORT → saves the current world to vr_state.json.

CLEAR → resets the world.

DEMO → auto-creates 6 agents (sun, moon, river, forest, code, dream) and merges them — perfect for presentations.


🌐 Beyond Demo — Coral & Solana

Coral Protocol → each frsig can be registered as a service in Coral Registry.

Solana → agents can be anchored on-chain:

fcp://BC|d=<frsig://...>;chain=solana
→ txid=solana_tx_abcd1234

Next step: mint agents as NFTs — share and exchange living worlds.

💡 Together: Coral gives the network, Solana gives permanence, and LivingOS gives life.

🚀 Roadmap

[x] MiniOS demo (single file, Flask + web UI).

[x] Text ingestion, merging, exporting.

[x] DEMO MODE for hackathon wow-effect.

[x] Stubs for Coral & Solana integration.

[ ] Multiuser rooms (ROOM/JOIN).

[ ] AI Bridge (LLMs as agents).

[ ] Full VR / WebXR fractal worlds.

🏆 Hackathon Submission

Submitted to Internet of Agents Hackathon 2025.
Tracks: Agent Track + Application Track.

> We are not building another tool.
We are building a new paradigm — a living internet where data becomes alive.
