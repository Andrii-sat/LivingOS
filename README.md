> **Not another chatbot. A new paradigm — a living internet where data becomes alive.**


## 🚀 Quickstart

Clone the repository and run the demo locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andrii-sat/livingos-mini.git
cd livingos-mini
pip install flask
python living_os_mini_wow.py

Then open your browser at:

👉 http://127.0.0.1:5000


🎮 Controls

ADD → type text → press button → new agent appears (✨)

MERGE → double-tap two nodes → hybrid agent is created

EXPORT → saves the current world to vr_state.json

CLEAR → resets the world

DEMO → auto-creates 6 agents (sun, moon, river, forest, code, dream) and merges them — perfect for presentations


🌐 Beyond Demo — Coral & Solana

Coral Protocol → each frsig can be registered as a service in Coral Registry

Solana → agents can be anchored on-chain:


fcp://BC|d=<frsig://...>;chain=solana
→ txid=solana_tx_abcd1234

🔮 Next step: mint agents as NFTs — share and exchange living worlds.

Together: Coral gives the network, Solana gives permanence, and LivingOS gives life.
